# Nuxeo iOS

Nuxeo iOS using an automation client written in Objective C.

For now, it's only a sample project that allows you to navigate through a Nuxeo repository and performing a fulltext search using [Content Automation](http://doc.nuxeo.com/x/mQAz).

Our next targets are to enhance the automation client:
  - Manipulate object instead of dictionnaries (JSON result).
  - Correctly handle HTTP results code / and anonymous navigation enabled
  - Have a correct error handling
